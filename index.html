      <h2>A Story of a young Explorer</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve grown up with the outdoors right on my doorstep. From a young age I
        came to love spending time outdoors and learning skills I’d need to
        survive in the wild. The outdoors became a place where I feel
        comfortable and an environment that I most felt confident in. For
        example, <br /><br />
        I’m not an academic kid and I’ve always really struggled with anything
        that involved reading and writing. I’m a practical lad, who has always
        been home-schooled and so this has given me the opportunity to learn
        more about the things that I’m interested in and build my
        self-confidence through becoming good at those things and learning new
        practical skills. So when I sit down to do the things I find tough, one,
        I’m much better at them but, secondly, I’ve found that I actually enjoy
        them. So for me the outdoors is not only an interest but a massive part
        of my education and something I’ve used to help me overcome my
        struggles. I see how much of a difference the outdoors can have on a
        young person’s life. <br />
        <br />
        I saw a post about British Exploring Society on Facebook a while back
        when I was looking at expeditions, explorers and adventure Facebook
        groups I could join. I clicked on it and it took me to a page titled
        something like “LISTEN UP YOUNG PEOPLE, come take part in our virtual
        adventures and explore the wilderness where you stand.” That sounded
        right up my street. <br />
        <br />
        My dream is to become a polar explorer and expedition leader who takes
        young people who are struggling in life – with their mental health, low
        self-confidence and all the other struggles that they face – on
        expeditions to help transform their lives. I have faced my own struggles
        and found solutions to them through my love for the outdoors. I have
        seen how much of a difference it makes to me, but at the age of 15 being
        an expedition leader is not quite possible and so I’m in training. Then,
        when I saw that the British Exploring Society do virtual weekly
        expeditions that I can join from the wilderness where I stand, where I
        could learn the skills I’m going to need to be an expedition leader from
        experts in their field, it sounded perfect! Looking back now I’m so glad
        I hit that sign up button. <br />
        <br />
        I love Wildestan Adventures and I’ve learnt so much. Each week is
        something completely new, ranging from how nature benefits your mental
        health to exploring quarries and cliffs or learning practical skills. I
        just kept coming back because I love being able to learn new skills and
        ask questions to experts who are enthusiastic and passionate about what
        they love and happy to share their knowledge with young people who are
        enthusiastic to learn. <br />
        <br />
        For me, one of my highlights was when we cooked expedition-style food,
        Fish and Chips gone wild. I love cooking, especially over a campfire or
        in the wilderness and so I loved cooking along and having tons of fun.
        My other highlights are the time when we went searching for bugs and
        other wildlife in a city centre and learning how to be more resourceful
        and reuse stuff that we see only fit for the tip and to reduce our waste
        – a skill that’s needed in the wild but also one that we need in our
        everyday life, now more than ever. <br />
        <br />
        The Wildestan expeditions have definitely boosted my confidence – my
        confidence in learning new skills but also my self-confidence. <br />
        <br />
        By unmuting myself, asking questions and chatting with the experts and
        other young people when that Tuesday evening came around once a week, I
        feel as if I have gained more confidence. It has definitely helped me to
        make connections with other expedition leaders which will hopefully help
        me towards my dream of being an explorer. Wildestan also gave me a
        talking point which most people were interested in. <br />
        <br />
        British Exploring Society is so unique and epically awesome. What I love
        about them is that they are accessible to all young people no matter
        what your circumstances and their expeditions and workshops are not only
        for people who have lots of money they make it accessible for every
        young person. From what I’ve read and heard and (hopefully will soon
        experience) is that their expeditions are no package holiday. They give
        teens and young people a real sense of adventure. Some people may think
        adventures are only for young kids who have a vivid imagination. Well, I
        definitely disagree, that sense of adventure is 100% buried deep within
        all of us and sometimes it just needs unearthing.
